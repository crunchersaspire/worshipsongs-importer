[V1]
Lord I lift Your name on high
Lord I love to sing Your praises
[O1]
I’m so glad You're in my life
I’m so glad You came to save us
[C1]
You came from heaven to earth
To show the way
[O2]
From the earth to the cross,
My debts to pay
[O3]
From the cross to the grave,
From the grave to the sky
Lord I lift Your name on high
